            <h3> Introduction Of Artificial Intelligence:- </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently one of the <strong>hottest buzzwords</strong> in tech and with good reason. The last few years have seen several innovations and advancements that have previously been solely in the realm of science fiction slowly transform into reality. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to replicate or enhance human intellect, such as reasoning and learning from experience. <strong> Artificial intelligence has been used in computer programs for years, but it is now applied to many other products and services.</strong> For example, some digital cameras can determine what objects are present in an image using artificial intelligence software. In addition, experts predict many more innovative uses for artificial intelligence in the future, including smart electric grids.</p>

            <h2> -: History Of AI :- </h2>
            <p>AI was a term first coined at Dartmouth College in 1956. Cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky was optimistic about the technology's future. The 1974-1980 saw government funding in the field drop, a period known as "AI winter", when several criticised progress in the field. Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to perform certain tasks, which need the intelligence showcased by humans and animals. This definition is often ascribed to Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy from the 1950s, who were also known as the fathers of the field.</p>
